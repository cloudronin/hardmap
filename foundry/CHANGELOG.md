# Changelog — foundry

## 0.1.0 (unreleased) — N0 scaffold

- **N0 scaffold — the product stands up and the Phase-K kernel reuse is proven.** New `foundry/` product
  (pyproject with the one-way `-e ./eightfold` install pattern; `AGENTS.md` invariants incl. the Rider-A
  sequencing note; README; CI leg). **`FOUNDRY_SPEC`** (`foundry/charges.py`): nine charges — seven oracle
  columns (decision/Schaefer, counting/Creignou–Hermann, approximation/KSTW, parameterized/Marx,
  parallelization/ABISV, proof-size/Molloy, **localization/Barto–Kozik** — the I6 hypothesis-bearing column) +
  two measured instrument columns (average_case, landscape); `derived` broadened to the oracle columns; a
  three-rule entailment layer (E1, E2 carried over + the CSP-native bounded-width⟹P rule). A hand-checked
  **toy stratum** (`foundry/census.py`: affine/XOR — the deceptive-terrain control — Horn, 3-SAT) exercises
  the schema. **Phase-K payoff proven** (`tests/test_kernel_reuse.py`, 7 tests): the shared eightfold validator
  + gap-list + null sampler accept Foundry's census rows under `FOUNDRY_SPEC` with **zero eightfold
  modification**; gate 6b (`side==value`) fires under `FOUNDRY_SPEC`; validating a foundry row against
  `EIGHTFOLD_SPEC` correctly fails. **`prereg_v1.json`** locks predictions 1–4 (P3 = untested, Factors absent),
  roster/generations policy, the Crucible-hardened battery, kill thresholds, and the I-phase (I1–I6) status.
  **F1 note committed** (`docs/findings/F1-canon-or-computation-note.md`, Rider C) — the predictions'
  timestamped provenance. **Next (post-defense): the I-phase, then N1 (CKZ co-clone roster + dichotomy
  oracles).**
